## üìã Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Java**: JDK 17+.
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle (Maven used in this project).
- **Docker** version 20+
- **Docker Compose** version 2.5+

---

## üìù Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```shell script
  git clone git@github.com:chertiav/online-book-store-app.git
  cd online-book-store-app
```

### Step 2: Configure the `.env` File

1. In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.env`.  
   This file will store the environment variables necessary to configure the database and application.

2. Add the following variables to the `.env` file based on the provided template:

```dotenv
    MYSQLDB_USER=<your_database_username>
    MYSQLDB_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
    MYSQLDB_DATABASE=online_book_store
    MYSQL_LOCAL_PORT=3308
    MYSQL_DOCKER_PORT=3306

    JWT_EXPIRATION=3600000
    JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>

    SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=8088
    SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=8080
    DEBUG_PORT=5005
```

3. Replace the placeholders `<your_database_username>`, `<your_database_password>`, and `<your_jwt_secret>` with actual values. For example:

```dotenv
    MYSQLDB_USER=admin
    MYSQLDB_PASSWORD=qwerty
    JWT_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP12345678
```

- **Descriptions of Required Variables**:
    - **`MYSQLDB_USER`** ‚Äî The username for the MySQL database.
    - **`MYSQLDB_PASSWORD`** ‚Äî Password for the MySQL database user.
    - **`MYSQLDB_DATABASE`** ‚Äî The name of the database used by the application (defaults to `online_book_store`).
    - **`JWT_SECRET`** ‚Äî A secure key used to sign JWT tokens. Ensure this is a strong and unique value.

### Additional Notes:
- The variable `MYSQL_LOCAL_PORT` specifies the port used locally to connect to the database, while `MYSQL_DOCKER_PORT` specifies the port inside the Docker container. These generally do not need modification.
- `SPRING_LOCAL_PORT`, `SPRING_DOCKER_PORT`, and `DEBUG_PORT` define the ports for the application and debugging and should match your local and containerized setup.

Make sure to save the `.env` file and avoid committing it to version control to keep sensitive information secure.

### Step 3: Start the Application

1. Once the `.env` file is configured, navigate to the project‚Äôs root directory using the terminal.

2. Use the following command to start the application and all required services via Docker Compose:

```shell script
  docker compose up --build
```

3. **What this does**:
    - This command builds the Docker images for the application and required services.
    - It starts the application, database, and any other dependencies inside containers.

4. Wait for the services to start. You should see logs indicating that the application and database are running.

---

### Step 4: Access the Application
1. If you are accessing the application **locally (outside the container)**, use the port defined in `SPRING_LOCAL_PORT`. Since the `context-path` is set to `/api`, the application will be accessible at:
``` 
    http://localhost:8088/api
```
2. To view the **Swagger API documentation**, navigate to:
``` 
    http://localhost:8088/api/swagger-ui/index.html
```
3. If you are working **inside a container**, the application will be accessible on the port defined in `SPRING_DOCKER_PORT`. Use the following address:
``` 
    http://localhost:8080/api
```
4. Similarly, the Swagger documentation inside the container will be available at:
``` 
    http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui.html
```

### Note:
- The separation of ports (`SPRING_LOCAL_PORT` and `SPRING_DOCKER_PORT`) allows you to work locally on one port and expose another port for Docker containers.
- Ensure you are accessing the correct port depending on your working environment.

## üîÑ Managing the Application

### Build Containers
Build the Docker containers if there are changes in the application or its dependencies:

```shell script
  docker compose build
```

### Run In Detached Mode
Run the application in the background:

```shell script
  docker compose up -d
```

### Stop the Containers
Stop all running containers:

```shell script
  docker compose down
```

### Clean Up
If you want to clear all containers and volumes, use:

```shell script
  docker compose down --volumes
```

### Stop Running Containers Without Removing Them
If you only want to stop the running containers but keep them without removing resources, you can use:
```shell script
  docker compose stop
```

## üõ† Obstacles & Solutions

### **Challenge: Running Locally with Docker Compose**
- **Problem**: Integrating the application with Docker Compose while ensuring smooth database connections.
- **Solution**: Used `spring-boot-docker-compose` starter dependency to simplify integration and manage service dependencies automatically.

### **Challenge: Managing Schema Changes**
- **Problem**: Updating the database schema consistently during development.
- **Solution**: Adopted Liquibase for schema versioning and included Liquibase scripts in `docker-compose`.

---

## üìÇ Postman Collection

You can find a Postman collection in `docs/online-book-store-app-api.postman_collection.json`. To use this:

1. Import the file into Postman.
2. Adjust Authorization headers (use JWT obtained from login endpoint).
3. Test all exposed APIs such as authentication, book management, and more.
